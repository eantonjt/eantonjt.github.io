            Software unit testing and verifying math formulas

        <div class="w-full m-1 p-2 md:w-4/6 max-w-[900px]">
            Throughout my teaching experience in math I have found that students often lack knowledge of how to verify that their derived formulas are sensible.
            While they usually have the ability to verify numerical results (such as realizing that they must have made a mistake if they got, e.g, negative variance, probabilities larger than 1, velocities larger than the speed of light), they lack an ability to perform similar verifications for derived formulas.
            I believe that students studying software engineering can use principles they learned about software unit testing to improve their skills in verifying math formulas.
            To introduce this connection I will use the following example:

        </div>

        <div class="w-full m-1 p-2 md:w-4/6 max-w-[900px]">
            
            <strong>Example (Balls in a jar):</strong><br>
            Assume that you have a jar with <i>n</i> balls inside. The balls can either be colored blue or green. 
            You will follow perform these two steps for a total of <i>m</i> iterations:
            <ol class="list-disc pl-10">
                <li>Pick up a ball at random from the jar</li>
                <li>If the ball is blue, paint it green and put it back. If the ball is green, you put it back straight away</li>
            </ol>
            So the amount of balls that are green in the jar will just continue to increase throughout this procedure.
             <br>
        
             <strong>Question:</strong><br>
             How many balls, on average, do you expect to be green after <i>m</i> iterations
             if there are <i>n</i>=7 balls in the jar, all balls are colored blue in the beginning and 
             you will perform the procedure for <i>m</i>=10 iterations?
             (You do not necessarily have to perform any major calculations to reach the answer)
        </div>

            So if you have chosen an alternative above, let's see how we can reach the answer quickly.
            The solution process can be summarized as:
            <blockquote class="m-5 border-l-4 border-[#334155] p-2">
                To gauge the correctness of a formula, modify the problem to one where you know 
                what the answer will be and then assert that your formula gives the correct answer in that case.     
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                For example, if there was only one ball and we only performed this process for one minute (so <i>n</i>=1 and <i>m</i>=1) then we can 
                quickly realize that the expected number of green balls at the end should be 1. If we insert <i>n</i>=1 and <i>m</i>=1 
                into our formulas above then we can see that Option 1 is the only one that gives the value 1, which means that it is the correct 
                formula. And since option 1 is the only correct formula we know that the expected number of green balls for the parameters <i>n</i>=7 and <i>m</i>=10 
                must be roughly 5.5. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To me this technique is very reminiscent of how one constructs useful tests for software methods.
                I believe that we can summarize the process of simple software testing as 
                <blockquote class="m-5 border-l-4 border-[#334155] p-2">
                    To gauge the correctness of a software method, insert input parameters for which you
                    what the output will be and then assert that your method gives the expected answer in that case.     
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            So in both cases we simply modify the arguments/parameters of our functions, and then verify that they output what we expect.
            I believe that the connection between verification in these domains is something that people can at times miss,
            and by making the connection more explicit I hope that software engineers who struggle with math can hopefully 
            approach the verification of formulas from a perspective which they are more familiar with (and likewise for mathematicians working with software).            
            <br><br>

            The rest of this blog post will be about different testing techniques to verify the correctness of math formulas
            that might differ slightly from techniques used in software testing, since the overlap of the fields is not 100%.
            The technique we used above to modify the parameters to create a problem where we knew the solution I will informally 
            refer to as <strong>Technique 1 (Modification of parameters)</strong>.
            
        </div>

        <div class="w-full m-1 p-2 md:w-4/6 max-w-[900px]">
            <strong>Technique 2: (Verify the formula in the limit)</strong><br>
            This technique can be seen as a special case of <strong>Technique 1</strong> but since software engineering rarely 
            includes limiting values I thought it could be instructive to separate them into two techniques. This technique can be 
            summarized as 
            <blockquote class="m-5 border-l-4 border-[#334155] p-2">
                If your formula should be valid for all input values, verify that it is valid when letting some input values 
                go to infinity or some other extreme value.   
            </blockquote>
            The reasoning behind it is that it is usually intuitively easier to know what the answer will be when one of the input values 
            is extreme in some sense.
            For example, assume that you are at an exam in physics and need to derive a formula for the amount of solar energy that is absorbed
            by a solar panel placed on your roof over a 1 hour period in the summer. You derive the formula 
            <div class="text-center m-1">Solar energy absorbed = <i>B</i> &middot; ( 1/<i>d</i><sup>3</sup> ) &middot; <i>A</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>C</i> &middot; (<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>+1)/(<i>d</i><sup>2</sup> - 1) &middot; <i>A</i></div>
            where <i>A, B</i> are positive constants, <i>d</i> is the distance from the sun to the earth and <i>A</i> is the area of your solar panel. 
            While the formula can seem complex we can easily refute it by checking what happens as <i>d</i> increases to infinity. If the sun is an infinite distance away then we expect 
            our solar panel to absorb 0 energy from the sun. 
            For our formula, the limit when <i>d</i> goes to infinity is <i>C &middot; A</i> which is positive and not zero, indicating that there is some error with the formula.

            Once again, one can see this technique as a special case of <strong>Technique 1</strong> but in this case the expected 
            answer that we assert against will not be a numerical value, but instead another formula. For example, from physics we 
            know that the distance <i>d</i> travelled by a launched object with initial velocity <i>v</i>, angle <i>t</i> and neglecting air resistance
             is given as 
            <div class="text-center m-1">  <i>d</i> = <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> &middot; sin (2 &middot; <i>t</i>) / g,</div>
            see image to the right for an illustration of this. Now we want to derive a formula for the distance <i>d</i> travelled when we 
            do not neglect air resistance. In our simple models we include an air resistance coefficient <i>r</i> which measures the strength of 
            the air resistance. If we have <i>r</i>=0 then that means there is no air resistance and if <i>r</i> is large then that means 
            that there is a lot of resistance. Through some calculations we obtain the two formulas below (assume <i>f, g</i> are some functions of the velocity which specifics we can ignore at the moment). Which of these formulas can we immediately 
            conclude is incorrect?
            
        </div>

        <div class="w-full m-1 p-2 md:w-4/6 max-w-[900px]"  x-data="{ showResult : false, clickedRadioBallBtn : false }">

        <div class="w-full m-1 p-2 md:w-4/6 max-w-[900px]">
            So if you have chosen an alternative above, let's see how we can reach the answer quickly.
            Since we know that <i>r</i>=0 corresponds to the situation when there is no air resistance, 
            we know that if we set <i>r</i>=0 we must recover the original formula, <i>d</i> = <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> &middot; sin (2 &middot; <i>t</i>) / g, that neglects air 
            resistance all together. Thus we see that alternative 2 must be wrong since for zero air resistance 
            we do not recover the original formula but instead we get an extra term <i>g(v)</i>. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So we can see that in this case we do not assert against a numerical value, but instead assert that it is possible to derive 
            the special case formula (where air resistance is neglected) from the more general formula (where air resistance is included).
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Final words:</strong> I hope that this post showcasing some connections between software testing and verifying math formulas will give you some techniques to quickly verify if your formulas are right or not. 
            For me, these techniques have often been used as sanity checks to quickly see if what I am doing is correct 
            and to discard erronous solutions.
