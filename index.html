            Throughout my teaching experience in math I have found that students often lack knowledge of how to verify that their derived formulas are sensible.
            While they usually have the ability to verify numerical results (such as realizing that they must have made a mistake if they got, e.g, negative variance, probabilities larger than 1, velocities larger than the speed of light etc), they lacked an ability to perform similar verifications for derived formulas.
            I believe that students studying software engineering can use principles they learned about software unit testing to improve their skills in verifying math formulas.
            To introduce this connection I will use the following example:

        </div>
        <div class="w-full m-1 md:w-4/6 max-w-[900px] flex justify-center">
            <div class="w-3/6 p-2">
                <strong>Expected number of papers marked:</strong><br>Assume that you have a jar with <i>n</i> papers inside. Every minute you pick up a paper at random and mark it with a pen and put it back in the jar. If the paper has already been marked you simply put it back straight away. You perform this process for a total of <i>m</i> minutes. How many papers on average do you expect to be marked if you are given <i>n</i>=7 papers in the jar and perform the process for <i>m</i>=10 minutes?
            </div>
            <div class="w-3/6 p-2">
