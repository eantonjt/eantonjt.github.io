            Throughout my teaching experience in math I have found that students often lack knowledge of how to verify that their derived formulas are sensible.
            While they usually have the ability to verify numerical results (such as realizing that they must have made a mistake if they got, e.g, negative variance, probabilities larger than 1, velocities larger than the speed of light etc), they lacked an ability to perform similar verifications for derived formulas.
            I believe that students studying software engineering can use principles they learned about software unit testing to improve their skills in verifying math formulas.
            To introduce this connection I will use the following example:

        </div>

        <div class="w-full m-1 md:w-4/6 max-w-[900px] flex justify-center">
            <div class="w-3/6 p-2">
                <strong>Example (Balls in a jar):</strong><br>
                Assume that you have a jar with <i>n</i> blue balls inside. 
                Every minute you pick up one ball at random from the jar,
                paint it green and put it back in the jar.
                If you by chance pick up a green ball from the jar that you painted at some previous minute, 
                then you simply put it back in the jar. You perform this process for a total of <i>m</i>
                 minutes (so you will pick up <i>m</i> balls in total). 
                 <br>
                 <strong>Question:</strong><br>
                 How many balls, on average, do you expect to be green after <i>m</i> minutes
                  if there are <i>n</i>=7 blue balls in the jar at the beginning and the duration is <i>m</i>=10 minutes? (You do not necessarily have to perform any major calculations to reach the answer)

            So if you have chosen an alternative above, let's see how we can reach the answer quickly.
            The solution process can be summarized as:
            <blockquote class="m-5">
                To gauge the correctness of a formula, modify the problem to one where you know 
                what the answer will be and then assert that your formula gives the correct answer in that case.     
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                For example, if there was only one ball and we only performed this process for one minute (so <i>n</i>=1 and <i>m</i>=1) then we can 
                quickly realize that the expected number of green balls at the end should be 1. If we insert <i>n</i>=1 and <i>m</i>=1 
                into our formulas above then we can see that Option 1 is the only one that gives the value 1, which means that it is the correct 
                formula.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To me this technique is very reminiscent of how one constructs useful tests for software methods.
                I believe that we can summarize the process of simple software testing as 
                <blockquote class="m-5">
                    To gauge the correctness of a software method, insert input parameters for which you
                    what the output will be and then assert that your method gives the expected answer in that case.     
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            So in both cases we simply modify the arguments/parameters of our functions, and then verify that they output what we expect.
            I believe that the connection between verification in these domains is something that people can at times miss,
            and by making the connection more explicit I hope that software engineers who struggle with math can hopefully 
            approach the verification of formulas from a perspective which they are more familiar with (and likewise for mathematicians working with software).
            


            While these verification techniques are nothing novel, 
            I believe that the connection between these domains is something that people can at times miss. 
            By making the connection more explicit I hope that software engineers who struggle with math can hopefully 
            approach the verification of formulas from a view which they are more familiar with and thus more easily make progress (and likewise for mathematicians working with software)
