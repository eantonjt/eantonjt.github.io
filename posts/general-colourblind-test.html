            (This post was adapted from my <a class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://antonfjohansson.github.io/blog_posts/colorblind-test-creation.html">old blog</a>).<br>
            Some time ago I wanted to create a program to generate the colourblind tests (formally known as Ishihara discs) where you have to distinguish a number or a letter inside a disc.
            Instead of restricting myself to generating discs that only contain number or letters, I wanted my program to allow the user to create a disc 
            containing any object. This can be useful for people that have developmental disabilities and who might have an easier time expressing that they can 
            distinguish a star or flower as compared to a number or letter.
            You can try a simple version of the program in the boxes below. 
            Draw something in the dotted circle and when you are happy press the "Create disc" button.
             Pressing the "Clear input" button clears your previous drawing into the dotted circle and "Download"
              downloads the Ishihara Disc.
            <br>
            <i>(Note: This program was made in my spare-time and if you are concerned about vision deficiences in you or someone you know, please consult a professional and 
            do not rely solely on this program.)</i>

            The program works by looping through these steps until a sufficiently large area of the circle has been covered by coloured discs:
            <ol class="list-disc pl-10">
                <li>
                    Randomize a position inside the circle. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check if a circle can be added to this position. A circle can be added to a given position if
                    <ol class="list-disc pl-10">
                        <li>
                            It does not overlap any previously created circle (we want this since the discs do not overlap in each other in an Ishihara disc).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The largest radius that prevents it from overlapping previously generated circles is larger than a set threshold (we want this since we do not want discs that are arbitrarily small).
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the randomized position lies inside the user drawn object mask, set the colour of the circle to have a foreground colour, otherwise set the colour as a background colour.
                </li>
            </ol>
