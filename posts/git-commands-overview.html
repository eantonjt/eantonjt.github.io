            This post simply details some git commands that I have learned about when
            reading the "Git pro book". This is mainly a summary for myself and to get a 
            reason to explore these commands more, but hopefully others can find the notes useful as well.

                     git clone GITREMOTE NEWNAME<span class="text-[#0b7800]">Name the folder when you clone it</span><br>
                     git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 myNewFolderName <span class="text-[#0b7800]">#Example</span><br>
                     git push origin my_local_branch:my_desired_remote_branch<span class="text-[#0b7800]">Push local changes on a branch to a different branch on remote</span><br>

            When I first started out with git I was not aware that origin/branch was different from branch. But if we just see 
            it as two different branches then it is easy to understand why we should not always do git pull, 
            and instead do git fetch and then sole any merge conflicts that appear etc.<br>
            Note that git clone does not need a remote does not need to be on another computer, you can clone from a shared drive or your own harddrive as
            git clone path/to/project.git and we can add it as a remote with git remote add local_proj path/to/project.git

            It can be good to ensure there are no whitespace errors before you commit, you can do this with git diff --check

            Note that we can combine multiple of these flags together, to for example search for strings in commit messages and then show the diffs introduced by those commits etc.
            By default, git log will only show commit history for the checkout branch, use the flag --all to see the log for all branches.

            <strong>Some other notes</strong>
            <br>
            Below are some definitions for some terminology that appears in Git.
            <ul class="p-3">
                <li>Author: The person who originally wrote the work</li>
                <li>Committer: The person that commited the work (This person can be different than the author if the author, e.g., sends the changes as a patch to the committer)</li>
            </ul>
            Even if you delete/modify a branch/commit one can at times still recover it...FILL IN MORE INFO<br><br>
            In VSCode one can easily handle merge conflicts. If one wants to merge a branch into another branch then just follow these steps:
            <ul class="p-3">
                <li>Go to the branch CURRENT_BRANCH that is supposed to get the new changes</li>
                <li>Press Ctrl-Shift-p and choose merge, then merge from THE_OTHER_BRANCH</li>
                <li>If there is a conflict one will get a choice to accept incoming changes or what is currently there</li>
                <li>When all conflicts have been resolved, add the file to the staging area and then commit.</li>
            </ul>
            Note you can do the same with remote branches but in some cases the Commit button can go away but then you can just type git commit in the terminal to finalize the merge.
            <br>
            <br>
            VSCode also has limited functionality for partial staging. Go to the staging area and then select the regions 
            that you want to commit and select "Stage selected ranges" in the top right.
            <br>
            <br>
            Git rebasing should not be done on commits that others have based work on.
            This is since rebasing will change the corresponding commit hashes and make it difficult 
            for others to merge later. Because for them, a certain history will have happened 
            but it will be different from what the remote says happened.
