            (This post was adapted from my <a class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://antonfjohansson.github.io/blog_posts/reddit-comment-analysis.html">old website</a>).<br>
            I was interested in analyzing how the assumed semantic meaning of the words "they're, their, there" has changed over the years.
            To me it seems that more and more people confuse these words and I thus wanted 
            to analyze if this confusion has increased over the years.
            To analyze this I constructed word embeddings for the words from Reddit comments and investigated
            how the similarity of the embeddings have evolved over time. The evolution of the similarity between the words can be seen in the chart below 
            where we see that the embeddings for the words has become more similar over time but that the increase in similarity has decelerated. 
            That the embeddings have become more similar could indicate that
            the semantic meaning of these words have been mixed up in a proportionally larger amount of Reddit comments over the years.

            I thought these results were interesting since they sort of agree with the initial hypothesis that the confusion regarding 
            these words have increased over time, but I think a deeper analysis is needed before one can draw any real conclusions. For example,
            <ol class="list-disc pl-10">
                <li>We do not what the baseline similarity ( where no confusion of these words is present) between the words is. It might 
                    be that these mix-ups are relatively rare and does not impact the final embedding.
                </li>
                <li> If the mix-up has an impact on the embeddings, could Reddit increase in popularity during 2005-2010 causing an influx of non-native English speakers 
                    explain the increasing confusion?</li>
            </ol>
            These future directions require some more extensive work, and are thus left as an exercise to the reader.

            <strong>A short description of how the entire analysis was done is as follows:</strong>
            <ol class="list-disc pl-10">
                <li>Reddit comments were downloaded from <a class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/">https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/</a></li> and data for each month was analyzed independently from the other months.
                <li>In C#, each reddit comment was checked to see if it contains either of the words "their", "they're", "there".</li>
                <li>For each occurrence of the target words in a comment, a context window of size 2 centered on the target word was constructed and a co-occurrence matrix of the words inside the context window was created.</li>                    
                <li>Every co-occurrence matrix associated with a given target word was added together</li>                    
                <li>After going through every comment, the cosine similarity was calculated between the co-occurrence matrices obtained for each target word to yield a similarity value for a given month</li>
                <li>Streaming bootstrap techniques (<a class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/r3/oza01a.html">link</a>) were used to obtain the error bars.</li>  
            </ol>
