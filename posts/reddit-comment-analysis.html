            Word Semantics in Reddit Comments

            (This post was adapted from my <a class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://antonfjohansson.github.io/blog_posts/reddit-comment-analysis.html">old website</a>).<br>
            I was interested in analyzing how the assumed semantic meaning of the words "they're, their, there" has changed over the years.
            To me it seems that more and more people confuse these words and I thus wanted 
            to analyze if this confusion has increased over the years.
            To analyze this I constructed word embeddings for the words from Reddit comments and investigated
            how the similarity of the embeddings have evolved over time. The evolution of the similarity between the words can be seen in the chart below 
            where we see that the embeddings for the words has become more similar over time, 
            possibly indicating that these words are being incorrectly used in more and more posts.
