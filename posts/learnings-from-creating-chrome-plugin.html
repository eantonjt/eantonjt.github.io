            This post will detail a little bit about a chrome plugin that I worked on and what I learned from working 
            on it. I worked on and off on this project 
            in my sparetime for a period of around 1-2 weeks spread out over 4 months.

            The project can be found on <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://github.com/eantonjt/Gutenberg-Enhancer/tree/main">github</a>.
            The main focus of this post will be the lessons I learned from working on the project 
            and what I would have done differently if I started it today. While it was fun making the 
            plugin, I do not think I will spend that much time maintaining it. This is partly due to 
            the code structure that I ended up with in the end but also that I did not find the final 
            product to be as useful to me as I initially believed.

            <strong>Project overview</strong>
            <br>
            I wanted to make a chrome plugin for the site <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">gutenberg.org</a>
            that would allow a user to play a book on the site like a movie. So instead of scrolling manually through the book 
            when reading, the book would automatically scroll down and you could sit back and relax. And to make this viewing of the book 
            enjoyable I also wanted to add features such as:
            <ol class="list-disc pl-10">
                <li>
                    Easily changeable fontsize so that a user could find a text size comfortable for them
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Custom color-settings like "Dark mode", "Sepia mode" etc
                </li>
                <li>
                    Progressbar showing the progress of the book and where the next chapter was.
                </li>
            </ol>
            The video below showcases how these features look like in the final version of the plugin.

            </div>
            While the plugin works well in the demonstrated video above, I will not 
            spend that much more time maintaining this project and I will detail a little bit 
            of why that is and the lessons I learned from it below.

                            <p>A reason that I will not spend that much time maintaining this project is that after using 
                                the project in its current state for some time, I realize that having the text scrolling 
                                down like a movie feels more like a short-lived gimmick to me than an actual way of reading 
                                a book that I could see myself using in the longer term.
                                <br><br>          
                                The issue was that I only started actively using the plugin after I had reached the stage where the design
                                 and layout was in a relatively finished state. I did create low-fidelity prototypes 
                                 in the early stages but I mainly used these 
                                prototypes to evaluate the feasibility of the vision I had of the functionality and not in the actual way I 
                                would use the product in its finished state. In my next project I will spend more time 
                                actually using the low-fidelity prototypes as if it was the final product. </p>

                        <div class="p-6">
                            <p>The plugin currently works directly on the HTML page containing the book.
                                Only a few new HTML tags are added to allow for scrolling effects and to create the control menus.
                               
                                This means that we are expecting most books to have similar tags and structure in their HTML pages
                                onto which we can add the plugin functionality. 
                               Unfortunately, since different contibutors use different designs for the books there is a 
                               variation in the used HTML tags and classes. Most of the contributors to Gutenberg appears to use
                                the same layout and tags, but there 
                               is a difference for some of the books which means that you either have to 
                               accommodate these special cases or not allow the same plugin functionality for those books.
                               This also makes it difficult to maintain the plugin over an extended duration since 
                               each new added book variation means the plugin needs to be updated.
                               <br><br> 
                               I believe that 
                               it would have been easier to maintain and work with this project if instead of working 
                               directly with all of the HTML tags in the book page (which contain factors outside of our control),
                                I had tried to extract something more robust like only the content in the p-tags and built the plugin
                                on that information. This would have reduced the functionality of the plugin but it would have been much 
                                easier to maintain and develop while still allowing for some of the original desired functionality.
                                At the moment there are some books where the plugin has some issues with some styling
                                because these books have slightly different formatting than the majority of the books, 
                                like this <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/71875">book</a> for example.

                            <p>I had to take an extended break from working on this project due to work and other 
                                things. Since I did not use any issue system to keep track of what should be done it 
                                took quite some time to pick up the project and remember the best next step.
                                <br><br>
                                At work I think most developers use some form of issue system, but it might be rarer 
                                to also use it for our own projects. I will try and start this habit from now on and 
                                see how it helps me.</p>

                            <p>When starting this project I had an idea of the final product and I was 
                                eager to start implementing it. 
                                I knew you could create a plugin using vanilla javascript and so that is how 
                                I started. As the project grew I realize it would probably have been easier if I had 
                                used some framework from the beginning, but refactoring at that stage would be 
                                time-consuming. 
                                
                                If I had spent a little bit more time researching different ways of creating 
                                chrome plugins from the beginning I could have gotten a better codebase later on 
                                and made it more easy to maintain the project as well.</p>

            <strong>Smoothly scrolling the text</strong>
            <br>
            The naive solution to scrolling the text downwards would be to simply put the scroll 
            inside a <code>setInterval</code> like, 

            <div class="bg-[#f2f1f1] p-2">
                <code>
                var scrollPosition = 0;<br>
                setInterval(() => {<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;window.scroll({<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;top: scrollPosition,<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;behavior: "smooth",<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;});<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;scrollPosition += 1;<br>
                }, 1000)<br>
                </code>
            </div>
            which will cause the text to scroll downwards. The issue with this technique is 
            that the <code>window.scroll</code> method can only scroll down 1px at a time, which 
            means that you will get a staggering scroll effect if you want the text to go down slowly.
            This can be seen on this <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://codepen.io/Anton-Johansson/pen/KKbLyeL">codepen</a>.
            <br><br>
            To get a smoother scrolling effect which is easier on the eye 
             we can instead put all of the text inside a div with id <code>content</code> and then
             use the <code>translateY</code> css effect with a transition duration as 
            <div class="bg-[#f2f1f1] p-2">
                <code>
                var scrollPosition = 0;<br>
                var transitionDuration = 0.12;<br>
                setInterval(() => {<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;var elem = document.getElementById("content");<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;elem.style.transition = "transform " + transitionDuration + "s" + " linear"<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;elem.style.transform = "translateY(" + (-scrollPosition) + "px" + ")"<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;scrollPosition += 2;<br>
                }, 100)<br>
                </code>
            </div>
            An example of such a smoother scrolling can be seen in this <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://codepen.io/Anton-Johansson/pen/WNLBMPM">codepen</a>.
            While this is not a complex solution or problem, I think it is interesting since I believe most people would probably 
            go for the <code>window.scroll</code> solution initially which does not work that well.

            <strong>Keeping the text focused when changing the font-size</strong>
            <br>
            A problem that became apparent when using an early prototype of the plugin was the 
            disorienting effect that occurs when increasing/decreasing the font-size 
            when you have progressed a bit into the book. 
            Since increasing the font-size will make every paragraph in the book take up more space on the screen,
            the entire content of the book will be shifted downwards when the font-size is increased.
            An extreme example of the issue this poses can be seen in the image below, and in this <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://codepen.io/Anton-Johansson/pen/PoXrydN">codepen</a>

            This effect an be disorienting to the reader and it can take some time for them to find their way back to
            where they were reading.
            <br><br>
            The solution that I used for this issue was as follows:
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-10">
                <li>
                    When the user clicks on "Increase font-size", find the HTML tag that currently covers most of the viewport area. Let's call that tag "A" (marked in blue in the image below).
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Find the top and bottom positions of "A" with respect to the current viewport. Let's call these values "a" and "b".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now increase the font-size 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Find the new top and bottom position of "A" with respect to the viewport, call these "x" and "y" and calculate the 
                    height of the transformed "A" as h = x-y.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shift the entire booktext so that 
                    the top position of "A" is placed at (a + (b - h))/2 with respect to the viewport. 
                </li>
            </ol>
            An image overview of what happens can be seen in the image below.
            <img src="../media/learnings-from-creating-chrome-plugin/book4.svg" alt="Example showcasing issue when increasing fontsize" class="mx-auto">
            
            As you could see when the font-size was increased in the overview video, this technique works quite well at ensuring that the 
            text stays in focus even when changing the font-size. The reason this works is because shifting the top position of "A" to (a + (b - h))/2 will minimize
             |x-a| + |y-b| (which is Math.abs(x-a) + Math.abs(y-b) for non-mathy people) 
            and thus put the increased size tag "A" at a position that matches well with the position it had before the font-size increase. 
            A geometric view of this is that the midpoint of the largened tag "A" is shifted to the midpoint of "A" before the font-size increase.
            Here is a <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://codepen.io/Anton-Johansson/pen/xxmoQbo">codepen</a> that demonstrates this solution. 
            <!-- Proof is simple, just set y=x+h and use that the median is the minimizer of sum of absolute deviations.-->
